# Pawsome Pudding
Pawsome Pudding is a website for a cat cafe. Visitors to the site can view the menu, read about the resident cats, enter into a prize draw, and find the contact information and address of the cafe. The website is aimed at cat lovers.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Header
  - The Header includes the website name, tagline, logo and navigation bar, and is the same on all pages of the website.
  - The navigation bar contains links to the Home, Our Cats, and Prize Draw pages. This will allow the user to easily move between pages. 
- The Why We Love Cats section has a brief description of the cafe and why its owners decided to open a cat cafe.
- The Food and Drink Menus allow the user to see allergen information and determine if Pawsome Pudding will cater to their dietary needs.
- The Contact section features the telephone, email address, and the physical address of the cafe.
- A map image shows the user where the cafe is located.
- The footer section features links to social media sites. The footer is the same across all pages.
- The Our Cats page features three short bios of the cafe's resident cats, including a photo of each cat.
- The Prize Draw page features a form with various inputs, allowing the user to submit their details for the chance to win a prize. It also includes a brief description of the prize.
- The submit button for the form will redirect the user to a Thank You page with a short message thanking them for filling out the form, and assuring them that they will be contacted soon. This page is only accessible by clicking the submit button, and should otherwise be invisible to site visitors.

### Features Left to Implement
- The navigation bar was intended to be sticky, remaining at the top of the page when the user scrolls down, while the rest of the header remains in place. At present this is beyond my capabilities, but can be added in the future.
- The map was intended to be displayed as an iframe of Google Maps so that the user could interact with it, but I was unfamiliar with the API requirements. Curently, I have commented out the iframe element and inserted a screenshot of Google Maps as a replacement, but ideally I would revisit this in future and reimplement the iframe.

## Design
### User Stories
- As a vegetarian/vegan, I want to see the menu displayed on the website, so that I know if this cafe will cater to my needs.
- As a new customer, I want to see an address, and a map, so that I can easily find the cafe.
- As a regular customer, I want to see special offers, so that I can be rewarded for my patronage.
- As a cat lover, I want to see information about the cafeâ€™s cats, so that I know they are well looked after.
- As someone planning a party, I want to see contact information, so I can arrange a booking here.
- As a visually impaired person, I want links to have text for my screen reader, so that the website is accessible for me.
- As a smartphone user, I want the website to adapt to the size of my screen, so that it remains readable for me.

### Color Scheme
As a cat cafe is a place a customer might go to relax, I wanted a color palette on the cool side of the spectrum, since these colors are more relaxing. I chose a dark purple to begin with, then generated a [color palette](documentation/color-palette.png) from there. 

Then I tested my color palette to ensure the colors would be readable and have good contrast once implemented. [My results](documentation/contrast-test.png) showed that a font color of #5e3a98 and a background color of #fbeaff was the most readable combination. I decided to use the color #00c9a9 as a border color, to add some interest.

### Fonts
For accessibility purposes, I wanted an easy to read font. I researched the fonts available from Google Fonts and decided to use the Open Sans font for main text, combined with Montserrat for the headings.

## Testing
### Resolved Bugs
- Incorrect syntax in the [style.css](assets/css/style.css) file prevented CSS styling showing in the deployed webpage. Changing 
```
body {
    background-color: aqua;
    color: crimson;
}
``` 
to 
```
p {
    background-color: aqua;
    color: crimson;
}
```
resolved the issue.
- An unneccessary space in the markdown for the inline links in the Credits section of this README was causing both the display text and the full url to show.
- A syntax issue was causing the checkbox list in the Menu Items section of the [Prize Draw](giveaway.html) form to display as a text input. Changing it from a datalist to checkbox tags resolved the issue.
- Submit button was not properly redirecting to the [thanks](thanks.html) page. 
Changing
```
<a href="thanks.html">
  <input type=submit value="Enter Draw">
</a>
```
to
```
 <button type="submit">Enter Draw</button>
```
and adding
```
method="get" action="thanks.html"
```
to the opening form tag resolved the issue.
- A missing .jpg file extension was preventing the image for [Milo](assets/images/milo) from showing in the [Our Cats](cats.html) page.
- The background image was not displaying as intended. Moving the background image css from the main tag into the body tag styling, changing the background-color value to transparent for the columns class and using a relative file path for the image resolved the issue.
- On the index.html page, the font awesome icon "fa-solid fa-envelopes-bulk fa-2xl" was duplicating itself. When using the inspect feature in-browser, the code displayed extra
```
<i class="fa-solid fa-envelopes-bulk fa-2xl">
```
between sections, which was not present in the code pushed to GitHub. This was also causing visual distortion of the map and footer elements. I resolved the issue by removing the original icon which was duplicating.

### Unfixed Bugs
- Google Maps iframe refuses to display in Firefox, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers. Other browsers untested.
